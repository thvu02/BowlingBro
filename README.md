Bowling score calculator and history web app by Jarred and Trung

## Project Description:
This is a side project done in collaboration between Jarred and Trung to create a web application that can benefit our bowling group. The goal is to have a web application that can calculate the bowling score of any valid combination of frames and to submit and track game records so individuals can see their bowling progression and high scores. 

## Features Include
- Ability to enter in any valid set of frames to calculate score
- Pulling/storing bowling records in database
- Public leaderboard for highest bowling score with field for name, score, highest number of consecutive strikes, and date
- Ability to manually input bowling game score frame by frame
- Capapability to take picture of bowling score and automatically populate input
- Graph that displays an individual's bowling performance within the last 30 days
- Save submitted image of the scoreboard (if applicable) of an individual's highest score and higher number of consecutive strikes

## Example Use Cases
- User got a spare on the 9th frame and wanted to see how much higher of a score they would've gotten had the 9th frame been a strike
- User has been bowling the entire summer and wants to see if they have been getting higher scores as the summer progressed
- A group of users wants to see which of them has the highest personal record for bowling in terms of score and number of consecutive strikes respectively
